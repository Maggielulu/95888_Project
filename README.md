## Please read this before proceeding
### For Feature 1
- I have separated the features into different workbooks. For Feature 1, since the web scraping will take a looooooong time, please just run the Feature1_test notebook to verfiy that my code in Feature 1 works, or you can just run Feature 1 and, like, spend 30 minutes reading cocktail recipes..
- Either way please have Selenium and its webdriver for Chrome installed: https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

### For Feature 3
- Please have Wordcloud installed: https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud
- The picture mask should work, please make sure it is in the same folder as the rest of the files

### For Feature 4 and 5
- Please have FuzzyWuzzy installed: https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy
